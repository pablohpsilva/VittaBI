### Project info

* Name: VittaBI
* App URL: [pablohpsilva.github.io/VittaBI](https://pablohpsilva.github.io/VittaBI)
* Description:

>
  This application idea is trying to use BI on [Vitta](https://vitta.me) database and gather informations to answer questions like:
    * What are the top 5 diseases on a country given a period of time?
    * What medicines should be sold on a given period of time and place?
    * Given this time of the year, how many flu (or any diseases) cases were registered?
  With information like this, this application could save lives, make pharmaceutical industry sell more medicines and help people get prevented from diseases; This could me used as a government tool too.
